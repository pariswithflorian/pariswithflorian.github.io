    <h1>Paris with Florian</h1>
    <h2>Private Cultural Tours with a Scholar and Author</h2>

    <h3>About Dr. Florian</h3>
    <p>
      I am a scholar and author specializing in anthropology and philosophy, with over ten published books and more than a thousand pages of academic writing. Fluent in four languages, I invite you to explore Paris beyond its surface — through its ideas, contradictions, and cultural layers.
    </p>
    <p>
      This work is also part of my broader research practice. As the founder of an interdisciplinary research lab in Paris, I see each encounter as an opportunity to share my passion for Paris — its history, its lived practice, and its evolving identity — not as a guide, but as a researcher and <em>flâneur</em> shaped by the city itself.
    </p>

    <h3>The Experience</h3>
    <p>
      Each tour is an intimate intellectual journey through the city's art, architecture, and historical topography — tailored to your interests and guided by conversation. Rather than generic commentary, I offer depth, curiosity, and connection. These are not scripted tours, but curated encounters with Paris.
    </p>

    <h3>Pricing and Format</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Private tour (1–2 guests): €450</li>
      <li>Each additional guest (up to 8): +€60</li>
      <li>Maximum group size: 8 guests</li>
      <li>Duration: 3.5–4 hours</li>
      <li>Meals not included</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Small group sizes ensure focus, flexibility, and space for dialogue.
    </p>

    <h3>Customization and Services</h3>
    <p>
      On request, I can coordinate additional services such as accommodation and transportation through trusted partners. Custom itineraries and thematic routes — from political Paris to literary salons, from forgotten revolutions to sacred spaces — are available upon consultation.
    </p>
